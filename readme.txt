== Description ==

Hi, I'm Sammy! I was born and raised in Tucson, Arizona. I didnt go to college after high-school, but I'm thinking of going to acting school next year. I'm basically looking for new friendships. I decided to make a simple application mostly because I believe Most Hated & Most Loved TOP 10s are one of the fastest ways to describe my self. Its like quick profiling, so people can get an idea about who I am in a second. 

If I feel that I cant stand it, I just add it to my list! (Sometimes there is no reason. 
For instance, I really dont like Victoria Beckham, and I dont know why:)) If I cant help myself, I just put it on my list! (I love the 80s, what to do?) You can contribute to the list as many times as you wish and share now!!

Best,
Sammy, Your Buddy At Heart!
